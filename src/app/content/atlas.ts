I played Division 1 soccer, ran the San Francisco Marathon in 2023, and ran a 32 mile ultramarathon with 8,600 feet of elevation in 2024. In each pursuit, I struggled to find and follow training protocols to optimize my performance. I mostly learned about strength, conditioning, and nutrition from athletes or coaches that posted content online and I always wished there was an easier way to consume the content they posted."
